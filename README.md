Project Overview
The Word Counter is a Python program designed to count the number of words in a given text provided by the user. This project will help you understand how to handle user input, manipulate strings, create functions, implement control flow, and display output in Python.

Requirements and Features
User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.

The input text is then used for word counting.

Word Counting Logic:

The core functionality involves splitting the input text into words and counting them.

This is done using Python's string manipulation methods.

Output Display:

The program prints the word count to the console.

The result is clearly displayed for the user to see.

Error Handling:

The program accounts for potential errors, such as empty input.

If the user provides empty input, the program will display an appropriate error message.

Code Comments:

Comments are added to the code to explain the purpose of different parts.

This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

User-Friendly Interface:

The program ensures a clear and user-friendly interface for input and output.

Prompt messages are easy to understand, and results are clearly displayed.

File Structure
word_counter.py
This is the main script that contains all the code for the Word Counter. Here are the key components:

get_user_input():

Prompts the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.

Returns the input text.

count_words():

Counts the number of words in the input text by splitting the text into words.

Returns the word count.

display_word_count():

Prints the word count to the console.

main():

Orchestrates the word counting process.

Handles error checking and displays results.# Motion-Cut-Word-Counters-
